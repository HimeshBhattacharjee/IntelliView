        "1. **Page Configuration**:\n",
        "   - **`st.set_page_config()`** is used to configure the initial settings for the Streamlit app. The configuration parameters are:\n",
        "     - **`page_title`**: Sets the title of the page to \"IntelliView\".\n",

        "   - The `navigation_sidebar()` function is called to render the sidebar, which provides navigation buttons for the different pages in the app. It ensures the app is ready for seamless navigation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Page Routing**:\n",
        "   - If `st.session_state.get('current_page')` exists (i.e., a page has been selected), the app dynamically loads the corresponding page from the `PAGES` dictionary.\n",
        "   - The `PAGES` dictionary maps page names (e.g., \"Landing\", \"Resume Analyzer\", \"Interview Coach\", \"Report\") to their respective functions.\n",
        "   - If no page is selected (on the first visit or if the session state is empty), the **Landing Page** is loaded by default.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - Based on the current page stored in `st.session_state.current_page`, the corresponding page function (e.g., `landing_page`, `resume_analyzer`, `interview_coach`, or `report_dashboard`) is called to display the content for that page.\n",
        "   \n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🚀 **How to Use**:\n",
        "1. **App Initialization**: On launching the app, the `main()` function is called, configuring the app's settings, rendering the navigation sidebar, and loading the appropriate page.\n",
        "2. **Page Navigation**: After the user clicks a navigation button (via the sidebar), the app dynamically updates to show the selected page (Resume Analyzer, Interview Coach, or Report).\n",

        "In this section, we use **ngrok** to expose the locally running **Streamlit** app to the internet. This allows you to access the app from any browser using a public URL, which is especially useful for sharing your app or testing it remotely. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Imports**:\n",
        "    - `os`: This is used to run system commands. We use it to execute the command that starts the Streamlit app.\n",
        "    - `Thread` from `threading`: This allows us to run the Streamlit app in the background without blocking the rest of the program.\n",
        "    - `ngrok` from `pyngrok`: This creates a secure tunnel from the local machine to the internet, allowing external access to the app.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Running the Streamlit App**:\n",
        "    - The function `run_streamlit()` starts the Streamlit app by running the command: `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8500`. This starts the app on port `8500`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Creating a Background Thread**:\n",
        "    - A `Thread` object is created to run the Streamlit app in the background. This allows the script to continue executing without waiting for Streamlit to finish.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Setting Up Ngrok**:\n",
        "    - `public_url = ngrok.connect(addr='8500', proto='http', bind_tls=True)`: This line creates a secure (HTTPS) ngrok tunnel to expose the Streamlit app running on port `8500`. The `bind_tls=True` ensures that the connection is secure.\n",
        "    \n",
        "5. **Displaying the Public URL**:\n",
        "    - Once the tunnel is created, the public URL is printed using `print('App is live at', public_url)`. This URL is the one you'll use to access the Streamlit app from anywhere."
